                                Photobiomodulation therapy is defined as a form of light therapy that utilizes
                                non-ionizing light sources, including lasers, light emitting diodes, and/or broadband
                                light, in the visible (400 – 700 nm) and near-infrared (700 – 1100 nm) electromagnetic
                                spectrum. It is a nonthermal process involving endogenous chromophores eliciting photophysical
                                (i.e., linear and nonlinear) and photochemical events at various biological scales. This process
                                results in beneficial therapeutic outcomes including but not limited to the alleviation of pain or
                                inflammation, immunomodulation, and promotion of wound healing and tissue regeneration.1 The term
                                photobiomodulation (PBM) therapy is now being used by researchers and practitioners instead of
                                terms such as low level laser therapy (LLLT), cold laser, or laser therapy.</p>
                            <p>
                                The fundamental principles that underpin photobiomodulation (PBM) therapy, as currently
                                understood in the scientific literature, are relatively straightforward. There is
                                consensus that the application of a therapeutic dose of light to impaired or dysfunctional
                                tissue leads to a cellular response mediated by mitochondrial mechanisms that reduce pain
                                and inflammation and speed healing.</p>
                            <p>The primary target (chromophore) for the process
                            is the cytochrome c complex, which is found in the inner membrane of the cell mitochondria.
                            Cytochrome c is a vital component of the electron transport chain that drives cellular metabolism.
                            As light is absorbed, cytochrome c is stimulated, leading to increased production of adenosine
                            triphosphate (ATP), the molecule that facilitates energy transfer within the cell. In addition to ATP,
                            laser stimulation also produces free nitric oxide and reactive oxygen species. Nitric oxide is
                            a powerful vasodilator and an important cellular signaling molecule involved in many
                                physiological processes. Reactive oxygen species have been shown to affect many
                                important physiological signaling pathways including the inflammatory response.
                                In concert, the production of these signaling molecules has been shown to induce growth
                                factor production, to increase cell proliferation and motility, and to promote extracellular
                                matrix deposition and pro-survival pathways. Outside the cell, nitric oxide signaling drives
                                vasodilation, which improves microcirculation in the damaged tissue, delivering oxygen, vital
                                sugars, proteins, and salts while removing wastes.</p>
