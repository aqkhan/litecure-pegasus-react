                    <p>
                        Photobiomodulation therapy is defined as a form of light therapy that utilizes
                        non-ionizing light sources, including lasers, light emitting diodes, and/or
                        broadband
                        light, in the visible (400 – 700 nm) and near-infrared (700 – 1100 nm)
                        electromagnetic
                        spectrum. It is a nonthermal process involving endogenous chromophores eliciting
                        photophysical
                        (i.e., linear and nonlinear) and photochemical events at various biological scales.
                        This process
                        results in beneficial therapeutic outcomes including but not limited to the
                        alleviation of pain or
                        inflammation, immunomodulation, and promotion of wound healing and tissue
                        regeneration.1 The term
                        photobiomodulation (PBM) therapy is now being used by researchers and practitioners
                        instead of
                        terms such as low level laser therapy (LLLT), cold laser, or laser therapy.</p>
                    <p>
                        The fundamental principles that underpin photobiomodulation (PBM) therapy, as
                        currently
                        understood in the scientific literature, are relatively straightforward. There is
                        consensus that the application of a therapeutic dose of light to impaired or
                        dysfunctional
                        tissue leads to a cellular response mediated by mitochondrial mechanisms that reduce
                        pain
                        and inflammation and speed healing.</p>
                    <p>The primary target (chromophore) for the process
                        is the cytochrome c complex, which is found in the inner membrane of the cell
                        mitochondria.
                        Cytochrome c is a vital component of the electron transport chain that drives
                        cellular metabolism.
                        As light is absorbed, cytochrome c is stimulated, leading to increased production of
                        adenosine
                        triphosphate (ATP), the molecule that facilitates energy transfer within the cell.
                        In addition to ATP,
                        laser stimulation also produces free nitric oxide and reactive oxygen species.
                        Nitric oxide is
                        a powerful vasodilator and an important cellular signaling molecule involved in many
                        physiological processes. Reactive oxygen species have been shown to affect many
                        important physiological signaling pathways including the inflammatory response.
                        In concert, the production of these signaling molecules has been shown to induce
                        growth
                        factor production, to increase cell proliferation and motility, and to promote
                        extracellular
                        matrix deposition and pro-survival pathways. Outside the cell, nitric oxide
                        signaling drives
                        vasodilation, which improves microcirculation in the damaged tissue, delivering
                        oxygen, vital
                        sugars, proteins, and salts while removing wastes.</p>
